# Sun Array Project

## Project Objective:

Gateway to full stack of microservices

## Roadmap:

1) Static content for website. This website shall:

    - Display an array of connected devices
    - Allow the user to configure each of these devices as desired depending on what they are capable of
    - Allow the user to gather all this data and make something useful out of it. For example:

        - Wash your dishes
        - Fold your laundry
        - Clean the kitty litter
        - Feed the dog
        - Start meditation sessions

2) The site will start out as a website but later we will also have mobile

3) Overarching concept:

    Input => Action => Output

    ## Outputs are about inputs and actions. If we did not achieve the desired output, it's because either the input or the
    action did not work as intended. 

    ## This site will empower everyone to use technology for what they actually need - not what they are prescribed to need.

4) Delivery methodology:

    - Start out with APIs
    - Then data
    - Front end can be the last thing

5) First product: an automated dishwashing system.
